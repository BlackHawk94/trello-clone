Hello and welcome to a project that I have built as an assignment for [Launch School - an online school for developers](https://launchschool.com). [Check out the live version here!]

This is my attempt at the recreation of a single board, from scratch, of the single page application Trello using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone, and Handlebars, with ExpressJS to handle the simple back-end.

This repository is mainly to serve as a personal journal of what I can achieve at this point in time since starting my education with Launch School ~8 months ago.
